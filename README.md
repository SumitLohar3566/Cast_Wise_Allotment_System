- SQL Objectives Covered

Total admissions

Category-wise student distribution

College-wise selection counts

Status-based filtering

Students with marks thresholds

Seats allotted category-wise

Ranking and sorting

Inner join, multi-table join, group-by aggregates

- SQL Queries (20+ Important Queries)
✔️ Q1: Total students admitted
SELECT COUNT(*) AS Total_Admitted
FROM Admissions
WHERE Status = 'Yes';

✔️ Q2: Students with college & their admission status
SELECT s.Name, s.CasteCategory, s.Marks,
       c.CollegeName, a.Status
FROM Students s
JOIN Admissions a ON s.StudentID = a.StudentID
JOIN Colleges c ON a.CollegeID = c.CollegeID;

✔️ Q3: Students admitted with marks < 75

Useful for special reservation category.

SELECT Name, CasteCategory, Marks
FROM Students
WHERE Marks < 75;

✔️ Q4: Category-wise total students
SELECT CasteCategory, COUNT(*) AS Total_Students
FROM Students
GROUP BY CasteCategory;

✔️ Q5: Category-wise admitted students
SELECT s.CasteCategory, COUNT(*) AS Total_Admitted
FROM Students s
JOIN Admissions a ON s.StudentID = a.StudentID
WHERE a.Status = 'Yes'
GROUP BY s.CasteCategory;

✔️ Q6: College-wise admissions
SELECT c.CollegeName, COUNT(*) AS Admitted_Count
FROM Colleges c
JOIN Admissions a ON c.CollegeID = a.CollegeID
WHERE a.Status = 'Yes'
GROUP BY c.CollegeName;

✔️ Q7: Highest marks student per category
SELECT CasteCategory, Name, Marks
FROM (
    SELECT *, 
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY CasteCategory ORDER BY Marks DESC) AS rn
    FROM Students
) t
WHERE rn = 1;

✔️ Q8: Students NOT admitted
SELECT s.Name, s.CasteCategory
FROM Students s
LEFT JOIN Admissions a ON s.StudentID = a.StudentID
WHERE a.Status = 'No' OR a.Status IS NULL;

✔️ Q9: Average marks per category
SELECT CasteCategory, AVG(Marks) AS AvgMarks
FROM Students
GROUP BY CasteCategory;

✔️ Q10: Colleges with zero admissions
SELECT CollegeName
FROM Colleges
WHERE CollegeID NOT IN (SELECT CollegeID FROM Admissions WHERE Status = 'Yes');
